# outreach-send-disabler

While Outreach is a fantastic tool for sales teams to build sequences and send out loads of
emails, sometimes organizations want to minimize which domains are used for such activities.
Outreach does not have native functionality to block users from sending from specific domains
so this app will periodically check and update mailboxes as needed.
