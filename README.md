# outreach-send-disabler

While Outreach is a fantastic tool for sales teams to build sequences and send out loads of
emails, sometimes organizations want to minimize which domains are used for such activities.
The reason for this is that cold-emailing can often times lead to domains being marked as spam.
Some organizations attempt to mitigate the risk of lower deliverability due to spam reports by segmenting
which domains are used for cold emailing.

Outreach does not have native functionality to block users from sending from specific domains
so this app will periodically check and update mailboxes as needed.
